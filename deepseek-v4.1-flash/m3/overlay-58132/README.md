# vllm#58132 overlay (decoder SWA bounded replay)

[vllm-project/vllm#58132](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/58132) ("Decoder-side SWA bounded replay for
DeepSeek-V4.1") was open and maintainer-approved but unmerged when we ran it on 2026-09-28. It lets layers 21–39 of
DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, which hold only sliding-window KV and take long-range context from layer 20's compressed KV, run
on each request's last 128 tokens in eager prefill steps.

[`pr58132-runtime.diff`](pr58132-runtime.diff) is the PR's diff restricted to its five runtime files (tests and CI
config dropped), as fetched with `gh pr diff 58132` at head `394e46fd`. It is vLLM code, Apache-2.0 (see
[`../../../NOTICE`](../../../NOTICE)). It applies cleanly to the files in image `vllm/vllm-openai:nightly-af7f9488…`, which
already carries the encoder side (#56227) and the fused MoE finalize (#58586).

`../swap-to-m3v2.sh` bind-mounts the patched files from `overlay-58132/tree/vllm/…` over the image's package
(`REPLAY_OVERLAY=0` boots the stock files). To rebuild the tree:

```bash
IMG=vllm/vllm-openai:nightly-af7f9488c2210d67e1033ecdc845b087ee7fe92b
C=$(docker create "$IMG"); P=/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages
mkdir -p tree/vllm/config tree/vllm/models/deepseek_v41/nvidia
for f in vllm/config/cache.py vllm/models/deepseek_v41/nvidia/{model,model_state,vl_model}.py; do docker cp "$C:$P/$f" "tree/$f"; done
docker rm "$C"
(cd tree && patch -p1 < ../pr58132-runtime.diff)
```

The boot log confirms it with `Decoder SWA bounded replay: in eager prefill steps, layers 21-39 run on each
request's last 128 tokens only.` Results: [`../DETAILS.md`](../DETAILS.md#decoder-swa-bounded-replay-vllm58132).
